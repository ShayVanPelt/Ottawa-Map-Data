You can view mean housing data alongside the proximity of each area to various amenities, such as schools, employment, public transportation, parks, and healthcare facilities. This combined visualization allows you to see not only the average cost of housing in different neighborhoods but also how conveniently located these areas are in relation to essential services and points of interest. By analyzing this data together, you can gain a more comprehensive understanding of how accessibility to amenities may influence housing prices, helping to identify areas that offer the best balance of affordability and convenience.
